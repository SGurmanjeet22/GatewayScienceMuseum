      <p>   My name is Austin Lapic and I was born in Santa Rosa, California on Friday, 31 March 2000. I was born with Hirschsprung’s Disease and had part of my colon removed when I was seven days old. My family moved to Pennsylvania for a year and we lived in a town that was only 30 minutes away from where one of the hijacked planes during the 9/11 terrorist attacks crashed into a field in Pennsylvania. I don’t remember my time in Pennsylvania and the events that surrounded me when 9/11 occurred, however, I’ve been told that it was extremely frightening. At the time I was in a day care at my aunt’s bank and we were placed on lockdown in fear of more attacks. We finally moved back to California and have been here since, living primarily in Sonoma County and then we moved to Lake County in 2008. </p>
               <p>  Lake County hasn’t been my choice of place to live, but I found some of my greatest friends since I’ve lived there. I moved to Middletown in the fourth grade, and currently still live in the area with my parents. While in high school I joined my local FFA chapter and started raising animals for the Lake County Fair. I first started raising chickens, about 12-15 in total, sold the maximum amount at the county fair, four chickens, and sold the majority of my extras to family members. The next year I raised two Boer goats, one of them died early on so the breeder replaced the one that died for me. I loved my goats a lot because they were super social and very sweet animals, it was hard having to leave them on the last night of the county fair because I had grown so attached to them. My final year attending the county fair I raised one steer and two lambs. The steer I raised for 10 months, and he was by far my favorite project. Sterling, the steer’s name, was an asshole for the first two months, but he finally turned around and became the sweetest animal ever. To this day I still miss Sterling, he was the best animal I could have asked to raise. The lambs were alright. I only say alright because lambs aren’t social creatures, but one of my lambs was starting to warm up to me towards the latter end of the project. My other lamb was sold as a charity lamb, and she raised over $5000 for the Lake County Fair Foundation, a foundation that helps fund the Lake County Fair. All throughout my time in Lake County though has been plagued with worry for my mom because she has Multiple Sclerosis. There were many times where she would be in the hospital because of an episode and she wouldn’t be able to function normally. It was especially tough when I was younger, and scared me at times in high school. I wouldn’t know if she went to the hospital until I got home from school most times. Sometimes she would come home from the hospital quickly in preference of not being on a lot of medicine and hooked to a lot of machines, and financially it would be easier on us if she wasn’t in the hospital. It’s not easy living with my mom because if something triggers a lot of stress, she could go into an episode and have to be admitted into the hospital. </p>
               <p>  Being in college has been both fun and stressful. I’ve enjoyed everything I’ve done in college, and I love all the friends I have made since the start of school. Crafty Cats has been one of my favorite activities thus far, especially the coaster painting. Crafty Cats allows me to be creative and have fun while doing artsy stuff, I can see my improvement in my art skills since doing Crafty Cats. I can’t not mention all the fun after school activities that I do, those are always fun ;) However, somethings have been stressful. Money hasn’t been an easy thing to manage with rent being super expensive and everything having a cost, it’s hard to end on a positive budget without needing to ask for help which is hard for those that I do ask. Another difficult thing has been prioritization of what to do, I’m wanting to study abroad to the UK and South Korea for my second and third year respectively, but I also am joining Associated Students Government on the Legislative Action Committee, and I need to make sure I pass all my classes. It’s been difficult, but fun and I don’t regret my decisions thus far. </p>
